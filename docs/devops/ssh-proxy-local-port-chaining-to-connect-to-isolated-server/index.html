<div id="content" class="visual flex one">
 <p>There you are with Internet access to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">AWS EC2 instance</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/virtual-machines/">Azure Virtual Machine</a> or <a href="https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/">VPS (Virtual Private Server)</a> as we called them in the good old days, but beyond that - on a Private LAN of some sort (could be an AWS VPC, Azure VNET or Physical LAN) - there is another Server, which only has a Private IP Address. This pesky Server is what you'd like to access SQL Developer on, from your own PC. Hmm...</p>

<h2>Diagram time</h2>

<p>Here's a more descriptive Network Diagram, showing more specifics around the issue, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your PC/Mac/Laptop
<ul>
<li>Private IP doesn't matter</li>
<li>Public IP is <code>99.99.99.1</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Internet-accessible VM
<ul>
<li>Public IP is <code>1.1.1.1</code></li>
<li>This is allowed through an Internal Firewall to SSH to <code>172.30.12.99</code> (sourced from it's LAN Private IP of <code>172.30.12.6</code>)</li>
<li>This is <strong>not</strong> allowed to connect on SQL Database (<code>TCP/3306</code>) to your <code>172.30.12.99</code> Database Server</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Database VM
<ul>
<li>No Public IP (not directly accessible from the Internet)</li>
<li>Private IP is <code>172.30.12.99</code></li>
<li>Has SSH Daemon/Server and SQL Server installed on it</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/ssh_proxy_local_port_chaining.png" alt="SSH Proxy Local Port Chaining Topology" /></p>

<p>The ultimate goal is to enable SQL Developer on your PC to somehow speak to SQL Server (<code>TCP/3306</code>) on <code>172.30.12.99</code>.</p>

<h2>SSH Tunnels - Local Port Proxy</h2>

<p>Which is where a handy feature of SSH comes in, where it has the ability to Tunnel.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Port Tunneling (SOCKS Proxy)</h3>

<p>You may have used this prior with <a href="https://dev.to/__namc/ssh-tunneling---local-remote--dynamic-34fa">Dynamic Port Tunneling</a>, where you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh -D 1080 user@1.1.1.1</code></pre>

<p>Then configure <code>127.0.0.1:1080</code> as a SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 Proxy in your Firefox Browser like this:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/firefox_proxy.png" alt="Firefox SSH SOCKS Proxy Options Screen" /></p>

<p>And then you can browse some http://internalserver in your Firefox Browser as if you're controlling/appear to be the Internet-connected VM to upstream Servers/Systems. That won't help you here, mind.</p>

<h3>Local Port Tunneling</h3>

<p>Instead, we're going to use Local Port tunneling, which looks a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@1.1.1.1 -L 999:127.0.0.1:3306</code></pre>

<p>It's worth breaking down what this does, with some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>999</code>
<ul>
<li>This is the port that will be listening on your PC (i.e. <code>127.0.0.1</code> or <code>localhost</code>, from your perspective)</li>
<li>Any traffic sent to this port is chucked through the Tunnel, for the other side (SSH Server on <code>1.1.1.1</code>) to deal with</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>127.0.0.1</code>
<ul>
<li>This is where you want the other side (<code>1.1.1.1</code>) to send your Tunneled traffic to (Destination IP Address)
<ul>
<li>Note in this case, it is itself; the <code>127.0.0.1</code> here refers to <code>1.1.1.1</code> going to itself, not your PC</li>
<li>Think of stuff after the first <code>-L</code> colon as "remote-side stuff"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>3306</code>
<ul>
<li>This is where you want the other side (<code>1.1.1.1</code>) to send your Tunneled traffic to (Destination TCP Port)</li>
<li>This is the TCP-using process (in our case, it'll be another SSH not SQL, as you might think) on the other side (<code>1.1.1.1</code>)`</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, this wouldn't do much - as there is no Database Server (<code>TCP/3306</code>) running on our first Jump Box (<code>1.1.1.1</code>) - so the next bit is where the chaining comes in.</p>

<h3>Local Port Chaining</h3>

<p>Leaving this SSH session (above) open, we open a fresh Terminal/Command Prompt/SSH session from our PC to <code>1.1.1.1</code>, with no Tunnels requested (bog standard SSH):</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@1.1.1.1</code></pre>

<p>Using this, we now tell <code>1.1.1.1</code> to SSH to our target Database (<code>172.30.12.99</code>), but this time we want the traffic to pop out at the actual Database Port (<code>3306</code>):</p>

<pre><code>ssh user@172.30.12.99 -L 3306:127.0.0.1:3306</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we can now connect to <code>127.0.0.1:999</code> on the PC, and it will traverse the two SSH Tunnels and pop out as being <code>172.30.12.99:3306</code> - even though that destination doesn't have Internet access.</p>

<p>Note in the above that the choice of using <code>-L 3306</code> on the <code>1.1.1.1</code> PC is irrelevant; this could have been <code>998</code>; but then the SSH command run against <code>172.30.12.99</code> would have had to read <code>-L 998</code> instead of <code>-L 3306</code>. All you are doing here is setting up listeners, and matching that number up between the two SSH Commands.</p>

<h2>What it achieves</h2>

<p><img src="/static/img/ssh_proxy_local_port_chaining_resulting.png" alt="SSH Proxy Local Port Chaining Resulting Topology" /></p>

<p>Which gets you out of a hole, and able to access a "Bastion" Server on a Private LAN or VNET somewhere, as long as you've got SSH access throughout the chain.</p>

<p>Have fun tinkering!</p>
