 <p>Are you used to Cisco IOS kit and trying to make a GRE Tunnel extend an Overlay VRF (or Routing Instance), using Junos SRX kit, and getting weird errors like this:</p>

<pre><code>(errno=1000) create nsp tunnel failed 1
(errno=1000) tunnel session add(gr-0/0/0) failed
</code></pre>

<p>Then read on, dear friend - this post's for you.</p>

<h2>Diagram time</h2>

<p>This is what we're trying to achieve, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underlay Network
<ul>
<li>MPLS IP VPN with own BGP/IGP routing setup</li>
<li>Two Juniper SRX Firewalls in two locations, connected to said MPLS IP VPN</li>
<li>Underlying Global Table or VRF "Prod" that those Firewalls connect to</li>
<li>Each Firewall has 1x 10 Gig Ethernet connection, Xe-0/0/1, connected to the MPLS IP VPN</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overlay Network
<ul>
<li>Routing Instance (VRF/Routing Table) called "Other" present on each Juniper SRX Firewall</li>
<li>We want to join together VRF "Other" on each SRX Firewall to each other, using a GRE Tunnel Gr-0/0/0.1 to extend them</li>
<li>We'll spin up a Routed /30 p2p atop this GRE Tunnel, so we can Static Route to it, each side, to get traffic from SiteA to SiteB</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/juniper_srx_vrf-based_gre_tunnel.png" alt="Juniper Overlay GRE Tunnel Topology" /></p>

<p>The ultimate goal is for <code>Gr-0/0/0.1</code> on each SRX to be able to talk to each other's <code>192.168.99.x</code> IP directly, over the GRE Tunnel (which gets transited atop the Underlay MPLS IP VPN, VRF "Prod").</p>

<h2>What your Cisco mind tells you might work</h2>

<p>This isn't your first GRE rodeo, you've played this game before, and done something similar on Cisco IOS kit, like this:</p>

<pre><code>interface Tunnel99
 description GRE Tunnel to SiteB Tun99
 ip vrf forwarding Other
 ip address 192.168.99.1 255.255.255.252
 ip mtu 1476
 tunnel source 10.0.0.7
 tunnel destination 10.1.0.98
</code></pre>

<p>That worked well for you, so you reckon some config conversion like this might bear some fruit:</p>

<pre><code>set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 description "GRE Tunnel to SiteB Gr-0/0/0.1"
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel source 10.0.0.7
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel destination 10.1.0.98
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel routing-instance destination Other
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 family inet mtu 1476
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 family inet address 192.168.99.1/30
!
set routing-instances Other interface gr-0/0/0.1
</code></pre>

<p>That'll do it, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h2>What the Juniper SRX errors to fight back</h2>

<p>So you try your <code>ping 192.168.99.2 routing-instance Other</code>, it fails miserably; then you go down to checking the Underlay Tunnel Source can ping the Tunnel Destination:</p>

<pre><code>PING 10.1.0.98: 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 10.0.0.7:
icmp_seq=0 ttl=122 time=5.661 ms 64 bytes from 10.1.0.98
icmp_seq=1 ttl=122 time=6.619 ms 64 bytes from 10.1.0.98
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, that's all fine, Alright, Juniper, what about a little <code>show log messages | last 10</code> then, eh?</p>

<pre><code>Aug 21 23:00:03 node0.fpc1.pic0 IFP error&gt; ../../../../../../../src/pfe/usp/control/applications/interface/ifp.c@3069:(errno=1000) tunnel session add(gr-0/0/0) failed
</code></pre>

<p>Huh, what's that all about?</p>

<h2>Hunting the Interwebs for clues</h2>

<p>Time to invoke Dr Google then, and off we find this <a href="https://forums.juniper.net/t5/SRX-Services-Gateway/SRX1400-Urgent-Request/td-p/286529">similarly afflicted person with an SRX1400</a>, with this key scrap of thinking material:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This error is when you need the static route if gr-0/0/0 and egress interface are in two different routing-instances. So you need to point the static route of the gr tunnel to the table that have the external interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not really sinking in, so you re-read it a few times; why does Junos care if my Gr-0/0/0.1 interface is in a different Routing Instance (VRF) to the Underlay, that's the point of the <code>...tunnel routing-instance destination Other</code> command, right, to tell it to set the destination of the Tunnel Endpoint into another Routing Table, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<h2>In Juniper land, Destination Sources you!</h2>

<p>It's probably best if I show you the fix first, then this might click - here is the fix to suddenly make the Tunnel spring into life:</p>

<p><code>set routing-instances Other routing-options static route 10.1.0.98/32 next-table Prod.inet.0</code></p>

<p><em>Note1: You'll need the other IP, for SiteA (10.0.0.7) as this inter-VRF Static Route for the other SiteB Firewall</em></p>

<p><em>Note2: You'll need to add that ".inet.0" to your Routing Instance name, because Junos and consistency don't mix.</em></p>

<p>So if you're like me, you're looking at that bemused, and saying to yourself: "But, but... I set the Tunnel Destination to look in a different VRF, right, otherwise what exactly is the point of that routing-instance destination command all about?".</p>

<p>Well, I'll tell you what I reckon it's to do, I think it's to set the <strong>source</strong> of the Tunnel (i.e. what Cisco would call the "Tunnel Source") to use the Underlay (Prod VRF) to form; not, as the fecking word in the command reads, the Tunnel <em>Destination</em>. Hence, as there is no command that sets the destination, it assumes the Tunnel Destination is in the same VRF as the Tunnel itself, so you have to set an inter-VRF Static Route to tell it to go into the Underlay to form the GRE Tunnel.</p>

<p>It's the only way I can reconcile it in my head, with you needing to add he <em>destination</em> route/prefix <strong>as well as</strong> that <code>...tunnel routing-instance destination...</code> command.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So there you go, in Junos land, this magic badly-named combo does what the sensibly-named <code>tunnel source</code> and <code>tunnel destination</code> combo does in Cisco IOS:</p>

<pre><code>set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel source 10.0.0.7 #Note this is in VRF Prod underlay
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel destination 10.1.0.98 #Note this is in VRF Prod underlay
set interfaces gr-0/0/0 unit 1 tunnel routing-instance destination Prod #Note this sets the VRF for the Tunnel Source
set routing-instances Other routing-options static route 10.1.0.98/32 next-table Prod.inet.0 #Note this inter-VRFs the Tunnel Destination
</code></pre>

<p>Mind you, in Juniper land opposites are clearly true, so maybe I should call this section the Introduction instead, seeing as it's at the end of the blog post.</p>

<p>If only Juniper sold mineral water, it'd be bottled at <em>destination</em> instead.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'll <em>start</em> now. Wait, do I mean <em>stop</em>...</p>
