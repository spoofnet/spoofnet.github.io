 <h2>Got Intel vPro AMT ME, bruv?</h2>

<p>Recently I've been trying and failing to get <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/products/community-edition/">Nutanix Community Edition (CE)</a> to cluster-up, with one ESXi-nested virtualised AHV/CVM and another physical AHV/CVM, running on an old HP Elite 8200 Small Form Factor Desktop PC. If you've played around with Nutanix, you'll know there's a lot of tinkering with the Host (Acropolis Hypervisor, AHV) Node to install the Controller Virtual Machine (CVM), and a bit of rebootery required; if you've been following this blog long, you'll realise that I'm not favoured with the Technology Gods - and my mileage often varies into many more reboots than the average bear.</p>

<p>When you're working with a frankenmachine (<strong>ProTip</strong> - Buy a 13-pin male Mini-SATA to 22-pin female SATA Converter to use the proprietary MicroSATA/Power Cable going into the CD Drive for an SSD), which you've put in your upstairs LAN Room, then the frequent trips up and down, and lugging a keyboard, video and mouse can get, well, annoying. Unless, that is, you've got Intel vPro, Active Management Technology (AMT) or Management Engine (ME) onboard your lovely business-class Laptop or PC - and then you can <a href="https://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/2011/10/using-intel-amts-vnc-server/">use Intel's AMT VNC Server</a>.</p>

<h2>BIOS Time - Setting it up</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the first part of this is the same as the How-to Geek article on <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/56538/how-to-remotely-control-your-pc-even-when-it-crashes/">How to Remotely Control Your PC</a> with some added time-saving, hair-tearing-out tips to follow later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with all good things in life (with PC hardware), the fun stuff happens in the BIOS. As per the links above, this is fairly simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your old school keyboard, video and mouse (or USB Crash Cart KVM Adapter, if Christmas time has just been) and plug them into your vPro/AMT/ME-enabled Desktop or Laptop (well, not Laptop, obviously because it's got a keyb... never mind)</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Furiously tap Ctrl + P to get into the Intel ME Settings BIOS</li>
<li>When asked for a password, unless you set it, it will be "admin" (without the speech marks)</li>
<li>Enter "ME General Settings", and
<ul>
<li>Change the password to something more secure (it'll need to be at least one capital letter, one number and one special character)</li>
<li>Setup the Network IP for AMT - think of this the same as an iLO/iDRAC/BMC, you can either "Share" the Host OS's one (but why, as you're tied into that), or set a seperate, dedicated IP for just AMT Keyboard Video Mouse (KVM) access</li>
<li>Hit Enter and OK on "Active Network Access" (or this was all for nought)</li>
<li>Configure the DNS-related Hostname, DNS Server and related settings (maybe something like amt-&lt;PC-Hostname&gt;, so you can distinguish the two in your DNS later on)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enter "AMT Configuration", and
<ul>
<li>Enable the "Manageability Feature Selection"</li>
<li>Enable "SOL" (Serial-over-LAN)</li>
<li>Enable "IDER" (ISO/Image Remote Booting)</li>
<li>Enable "Legacy Redirection Mode" (By Legacy they mean "Using something sensible like VNC Viewer, rather than crappy Intel-proprietary KVM Viewers)</li>
<li>Enable "KVM Feature Selection"</li>
<li>Disable "User Opt-in"
<ul>
<li>If you leave it enabled, the non-existent person in front of the real keyboard/video/mouse that you plugged in will have to type a challenge/response string to allow you in, which defeats the point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enable "Opt-in configurable from Remote IT"
<ul>
<li>For when you sit back at your desk, and realise you didn't do the step above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Escape/Escape/Escape/Yes/Save/OK</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we've setup most of it, what can we do?</p>

<h2>Stage 1 - The ME Web GUI</h2>

<p>Now you've done all that BIOS work, here comes the first payoff - a lovely Web User Interface you can access via http://&lt;AMT-IP-ADDRESS&gt;:16992, as per example below (my AMT IP is 10.0.0.12):</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_login.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI Login Screen" /></p>

<p>The kind of information you get to see here includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>System Information
<ul>
<li>Model, BIOS, Firmware etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_sysinfo.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI System Information Screen" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Memory Information
<ul>
<li>Type, Number of DIMMs, Size etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_meminfo.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI Memory Information Screen" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Disk Information
<ul>
<li>Type, Size, Manufacturer etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_diskinfo.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI Disk Information Screen" /></p>

<ul>
<li>Event Logs
<ul>
<li>Last Power, Last Crash, Case Opened etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_eventlogs.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI Disk Event Logs Screen" /></p>

<p>Then there's the juicy ones that you literally don't want (or have) to leave your chair for any more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remote Power On/Off/Reboot
<ul>
<li>Including "Next Boot" actions (i.e. Boot to USB, Boot to BIOS etc)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_webui_remotecontrol.gif" alt="Intel AMT WebUI Disk Remote Control Screen" /></p>

<h2>Stage 2 - But Ma, where's my KVM?</h2>

<p>If you've read this far, you're probably thinking you've been short-changed here; I promised you a KVM and I've delivered you a fancy Web GUI. So here's the fun part; you'll need one of the following to actually enable the VNC-based KVM functionality to work:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Windows App) <a href="https://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander">MeshCommander</a></li>
<li>(Windows App) <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/97425/Intel-Manageability-Commander">Intel Manageability Commander</a></li>
<li>(Windows SDK) Download Intel SDK, extract it some place and execute "KVMControlApplication.exe" (hiding away under the "Windows", and then "bin" directories (<strong>ProTip</strong> - You'll need to install Microsoft dotNET for this, so get a brew break ready), and you can then "Edit Machine Settings", login with "admin" and the &lt;AMT-PASSWORD&gt; you set earlier, and click "Machine Settings", then "Enabled - all ports" - as described in this <a href="https://blog.michael.kuron-germany.de/2011/10/using-intel-amts-vnc-server/">lovely blog post</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which you chose, here's a big tip - the "RFB Password" has to be exactly 8 characters, and include at least one each of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A capital letter</li>
<li>A number</li>
<li>A special character (i.e. @,'| etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>That tip right there saved you two hours of Googling "Error 400" and "XML invalid", and - my personal favourite - "KVM no respond" errors.</p>

<p>You can also do this from within MeshCommander, you click on the following sections, and then you'll get a prompt to chose the KVM "Enabled - all ports" and "RFB Password" (Intel-speak for "VNC Login Password")</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_meshcommander_enable_kvm.gif" alt="Intel AMT MeshCommander Enable KVM Screen" /></p>

<h2>Stage 3 - Look Ma, no hands(-eyes engineer lugging his ass upstairs)!</h2>

<p>Once done, you can now use a standard VNC Client* to connect via &lt;AMT-IP-ADDRESS&gt;:5900 the same you would with any other standard VNC Server:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Windows, only RealVNC seemed to work. On Mac OS X, only VNC Viewer seemed to work. On Linux (Debian), only Remmina seemed to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_vnc_firstconnect.gif" alt="Intel AMT VNC Remote Desktop" /></p>

<p>You'll then be prompted for the VNC Password (this is the pesky 8-character RFB Password):</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_vnc_password.gif" alt="Intel AMT VNC Password Prompt" /></p>

<p>And finally given a lovely KVM VNC session into your vPro-enabled PC or Laptop:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/amt_vnc_kvm.gif" alt="Intel AMT VNC Session" /></p>

<p>Et voila - the poor man's iDRAC/iLO/CIMC/&lt;BMC acronym of choice here&gt; is complete!</p>

<p>Note, if you have a Windows PC and don't want to enable the VNC (TCP/5900) part, then both MeshCommander and Intel Manageability Commander have a built-in, non-VNC KVM Client, which seems to speak some magical SOL/IDER "backdoor" protocol into the AMT chip, so they always work, regardless of you turning on/off the "Legacy ports" settings.</p>
